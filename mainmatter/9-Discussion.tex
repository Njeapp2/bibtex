Summarize key results
Short, only main question

2: Interpretation of results
Results per theme/question?
Interpret results:

- Did results meet expectations or hypotheses
- Contextualize findings within previous research and theory
- Explain unexpected results and evaluate their significance
- Consider possible alternative explanations and make an argument for your position

3: Implication
Do results support or challenge existing theories and literature? 
If they support existing theories, what new information do they contribute?
If they challenge existing theories, why do you think that is?
Are there any practical implications?

4: Limitations
provide an accurate picture of what can and cannot be concluded from your study.
Limitations might be due to research design, methodological choices, or unanticipated obstacles that emerged.
