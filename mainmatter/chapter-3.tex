\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{p{3.5cm}X} % fixed width first column
\toprule
\textbf{Stakeholders} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Dredgers & Dredgers extract sand and gravel from the Paraná Guazú, ranging from small independent vessels to organized groups of boats (areneros) and larger hopper ships. They operate mainly in shallow areas where simple extraction methods are possible, transporting the material to nearby ports such as Ibicuy or Brazo Largo. \\
\midrule
Prefectura Naval Argentina (PNA) & Prefectura Naval Argentina (PNA) serves as Argentina’s coast guard and river police, operating under the Ministry of National Security. It is responsible for protecting rivers and maritime territory, ensuring safety, security, and regulatory compliance. In the Paraná Guazú, PNA plays a key role in monitoring dredging activity and maintaining lawful use of waterways. \\
\midrule
Agencia Nacional de Puertos y Navegación (ANdPyN) & Agencia Nacional de Puertos y Navegación is the authority in charge of implementing and controlling the signalling system, as well as overseeing dredging and maintenance along the Main Waterway, which includes the Paraná Guazú. As an independent agency within the Ministry of Economics, it ensures navigational safety and operational continuity of ports and waterways. \\
\midrule
Ports & Ports serve as key logistical hubs for handling and storing goods extracted or transported along the Paraná Guazú. They provide the facilities where dredged sand is unloaded and traded, connecting local extraction activities with broader commercial markets. Their role is essential in enabling the flow of materials and supporting both regional trade and industrial supply chains. \\
\midrule
Fishermen & Fishermen on the Paraná Guazú depend on the river’s abundant fish resources, particularly migratory species such as sábalo, surubí, boga, pacú, and dorado. Most are independent artisanal fishers, selling their catch through middlemen, freezing plants, or informal markets. Although associations exist in the region, they hold little influence in decision-making over river use and management. \\
\midrule
NGOs & Non-governmental organizations play a role in monitoring the social and environmental impacts of activities along the Paraná Guazú. They advocate for sustainable river management, community interests, and the protection of ecosystems affected by dredging and trade. Their involvement adds external oversight and pressure on both companies and authorities to adopt responsible practices. Major players in the region of the Paraná are WWF,   \\
\midrule
Landowners & The landowners in the area have an interest in the sand mining activities. After all, some of them live in the area and they will experience any negative consequences to their land. Jorge Moriatan is a local landowner that was contacted during the study to tell about his experiences related to the dredging. \\
\midrule
Filmmakers & Alejo Di Risio is a filmmaker who directed a documentary on the Paraná–Paraguay waterway, focusing on the impacts of trade along the river system. His work highlights the economic and social dimensions of waterway use, bringing public attention to stakeholders and their activities. He was also contacted during this study to provide additional insights into stakeholders and businesses connected to the waterway. \\

\section{Stakeholders Influence}

After identifying stakeholders, it is important to evaluate their power and interest in the project. This is visualized using a power versus interest matrix, with power on the vertical axis and interest on the horizontal axis. Analyzing this matrix informs strategies to approach specific stakeholders. In addition to interest and power, a support-opposition matrix is analyzed to visualize the likelihood that a certain stakeholder will support or oppose the project.

\subsection{Power vs. Interest}

The power versus interest matrix is divided into four parts, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:power-interest}. The quadrants represent the power and interest that a particular stakeholder has in terms of low or high. High power and high interest are referred to as the players, and these will be of most importance to the project. Next, the quadrant with low power and high interest is considered the subject. Those with high power but low interest are determined as the context setters. The context setters are not closely related to the project, but can be of great importance. The quadrant of low power and low interest is recognized as the crowd.

    \includegraphics[width=0.70\linewidth]{figures/ch3/PowerVSInterest.png}
    \caption{Power vs. Interest}
    \label{fig:power-interest}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Key Players}
The key players, stakeholders with both high interest and power, are of great importance to the project. Among this group, there are the actors with a great economic interest in the dredging activity: the dredgers and the ports. They are commercially organized, which is why their power is also high. Finally, the ANPYN, being the responsible government agency, is an actor with both a great interest and power.

This is the most important group for project success. These stakeholders must be actively engaged and managed through continuous and tailored communication. They should be consulted in decision-making and kept up to date on risks, challenges, and progress. Building strong relationships with them is vital to ensure their ongoing support and alignment with project goals.

\subsubsection{Context Setters}
Context setters have high power but relatively low interest in the project. Within this group, the PNA can be found. Being a major government organization responsible for safety and compliance with maritime laws, they have significant authority and influence. However, their focus will most likely not be on the Paraná Guazú.

The context setters are of moderate priority to the project. Since they hold power, it is important to prevent dissatisfaction that could derail progress. The dealing strategy should focus on maintaining their satisfaction without overwhelming them with details. Periodic check-ins and concise reports or briefings can help with this. This ensures they feel respected and considered, as their influence may become critical if project circumstances shift.

\subsubsection{Subjects}
On the bottom right of the graph, one can find the subjects, a group that holds high interest in the project but has less power. Here the NGOs, landowners and campings can be found. Because of ideological believes or personal concerns, their interest in the project is high. However, due to a limited degree of organization their power is not substantial.

This is another group of moderate priority to the project. The stakeholders care deeply about the project but lack significant power to influence its direction. Any enthusiasm from this group can be valuable and should thus be maintained and leveraged if useful. However, it is perhaps more likely for stakeholders in the group of subjects to be opposed to the project. In this case, their high level of interest may manifest as opposition or criticism. Therefore, it is important to listen actively to their concerns and provide information to address any misconceptions or fears. This way, any opposition can be managed and maintained.

\subsubsection{The Crowd}
Finally, there is the crowd. Stakeholders in this group are characterized by a low power and low interest in the project. The journalists and fishermen fall under this group: they are largely unorganized and, although sometimes important, sand mining is not their main concern.

This group is the least important to the project's outcomes. Since their involvement is not crucial, one should avoid overloading them with unnecessary details and should instead only monitor them. It is possible to update the crowd on important progress as to prevent disengagement or frustration.


\subsection{Power vs. Support-Opposition}

The support-opposition matrix is divided into four parts and a linear trend line is based on the points given to the stakeholders. On the vertical axis, the division between support and opposition is made, while on the horizontal axis, the power is represented. For the degree of power, the power versus interest matrix, in Figure \ref{fig:power-interest} was used. The stakeholders support or opposition for the project was based on the interviews held during the field trip and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:support-opposition-power}.

\section{Conclusion}
text

% \section{Dredgers (LOCAL??)}
% The first dominant group of stakeholders are the dredgers.These include the local boats used in the area to extract sand and gravel from the river. There are several different types of dredgers ranging from small independent boats, to groups of small boats that work for the same employer (ARENEROS??), or big extracting ships commonly referred to as 'hoppers'. In the area of interest, the Paraná Guazú from Ibicuy to Brazo Largo, the most common dredgers are: (ARENEROS, INDEPENDENT BOATS). 

% Currently there are 2 active boats in the zone of the Rio Paraná Guazú of interest, and (QUITE A LOT MORE IN IBICUY?? FROM INTERVIEW), as mentioned in the previous Chapter. (DREDGING ACTIVITY AANGEVEN WELKE BOTEN, MAPS MET HEEN EN TERUG REIS, DATA , ETC)

% Their interest in the Rio Paraná Guazú is to extract the sand in locations of the river that are shallow since they do not possess any technology to mine the sand from deep. Once this water mixed sand is lifted onto the boat, they transport it to the nearest ports, Ibicuy or Brazo Largo. They sell their sand to the highest bidder which can be for (PURPOSES FROM INTERVIEW).


% \section{BIG Dredging Companies?}
% because they buy the sand and employ the areneros?
% The Dredging companies active in the Rio Paraná Guazú are :

% \section{Prefectura Naval Argentina}
% The Prefectura Naval Argentina (PNA), is the National Naval Prefecture of the Rio Paraná. Therefore, they are also active in the Paraná Guazú and our area of surveillance. 
% It is in their interest to protect the Rio Paraná Guazú from criminal activities. These can 

% \section{Agencia Nacional de Puertos y Navegación}
% The Agencia Nacional de Puertos y Navegación (ANPYN), or the National Agency of Ports and Navigation, was created on January 6, 2025 by a merger of the Undersecretariat of Ports, Waterways and Merchant Marine and the General Port Administration. Since then, the agency has taken over the tasks of the two former entities and is now responsible for policies concerning ports, waterways and river and maritime transport. As such, keeping the Vía Navegable Troncal (VNT), Argentina's main waterway, navigable for ships is an important task for the agency. To achieve this, they regulate dredging and sand mining contracts and oversee compliance with the relevant regulations \autocite{boletinoficialdelarepublicaargentinaAgenciaNacionalPuertos2025}.

% \section{Ports}
% In the researched area there are two strategic port locations that play a key role in the sand extraction.

% \section{Fishermen}
% Fischermen is another stakeholder group relevant for this study. The Rio Paraná Guazu is used by a lot of people for its high concentration of fish. 

% The artisanal fisheries play an economic role as most of the harvest is sold to middlemen, freezing plants, or in informal markets. Of particular interest are long-range migratory species such as sábalo (Prochilodus lineatus), surubí (Pseudoplatystom corruscans, P. reticulatus), boga (Megaleporinus obtusidens), pacú (Piaractus mesopotamicus), and dorado (Salminus brasiliensis), that support artisanal, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, as observed in other large neotropical rivers, \autocite{assessment of sabalo}, \autocite{fishers' knowledge}

% the fischermen in the region of interest are mostly independent. Even though there exists such thing as fischermen associations in the Rio Paraná Guazú, they are not influencial 



% \section{NGO's}
% even wachten tot ik een nice milieu organisatie vind.

% \section{Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos}
% Even wachten tot interview met hun, kijken of ze wel relevant zijn


% \section{Filmmaker}

% When researching for the stakeholders which were relevant for the analysis. We stumble upon an article on a film that was made on the Parana-Paraguay waterway. In this documentary, the focus is on the impact of the trade happening on the Parana-Paraguay waterway. The documentary is made by filmmaker Alejo Di Risio, who was contacted through journalist Matias Avramow for any additional information about stakeholders and business related to the waterway.
