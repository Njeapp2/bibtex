\chapter{Methodology}


\section{Data collection}
In order to analyse and make conclusions of the given situation, data collection is one of the necessary preliminary steps in the project. 
The collecting of the data for the Rio Paraná is done through multiple sources.

\textit{Instituto Nacional del Agua (INA)}

The first source used for our data collection is the available data from the Institute of Water INA. Since collaboration between TU Delft and INA is the key motive for this study, our group of students and INA work with a 'our data is your data' policy. This is how the first income of data files were given to us, the work made by employees from the institute themselves. A few examples would be papers written by C.R. Hackney, Mariano Re, Leandro Kazimierski amongst other authors that serve as comparative background studies.

\textit{Contacts INA}

Secondly, INA have also shared us their list of data gathered from connections they have, websites and other stakeholders they have contact with. 
Consequently, this made it possible for us to get access to the bathymetry profile over the whole Paraná as well as the waterlevel data from the governmental website.
For flow and sediment series of the Bermejo, Paraná and the Paraguay rivers, governmental data fiches have once again been used. This includes websites like Sistema Nacional de Informacion Hidrica (SNIH), punctual water data measurements from the governmental department 'Alerta', or the data from the Prefectural Naval Argentina (PNA).

\subsection{Measurement stations}
The measurement stations that were used for the data collection are discussed in this section. In order to have accurate estimations of the sediment content in the lower Paraná, it is interesting to consider its origin. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:origin sediment content}, most of the sediments in the middle Paraná originate from the Bermejo river in northern Argentina. A representative measurement station for this river is found near El Colorado, Formosa province. Here, the SNIH reports long series of measurements of water elevation, discharge and sediment concentrations.

Moving downstream, the Bermejo confluences with the Paraguay river. Merely 80 kilometers further downstream, the confluence of the Paraguay and Paraná river is located, near the city of Corrientes. Here, a drastic change in fluvial discharge occurs. Therefore, a station that represents the flow in the Middle Paraná is sought. Approximately 500 kilometers downstream of the confluence, the Túnel Subfluvial station near Santa Fe has a good amount of data. See Figure \ref{fig:rio parana map} for the location of El Colorado and Paraná. 

The two main tributaries of the Paraná that later flow into the Río de la Plata are the Paraná de las Palmas, and the Paraná-Guazú. To examine the distribution of discharge and sediment concentrations over these tributaries, two stations are selected and shown in Figure \ref{fig:flow partition}. First, the Zarate station is considered on the Paraná de las Palmas. On the Paraná-Guazú, the Brazo Largo station is selected for data analysis. Table \ref{tab:stations data collection} presents the data for all stations considered. Note that every dataset contains measurements of water level, discharge, fine sediment concentration and course sediment concentration. Most of the data is measured monthly, however some information is recorded on shorter time intervals.

\subsection{Dredging quantities}
The number of vessels involved in dredging activities on the Paraná Guazú was determined using AIS (Automatic Identification System) data. Vessel movements between dredging sites and ports were monitored through \textit{MarineTraffic}. Although historical records were not considered, the daily activity observed during the study period provides a reliable estimate of the sand extraction volumes. 

Alternatively, a collection of dredging permits is considered. To avoid adverse impacts on the hydraulic regime of the river due to dredging, companies must first obtain permits from the \textit{National Water Institute }(INA). These permits specify the locations and volumes of the proposed dredging activities. The information they provide serves as a reliable estimate of the total material being removed from the river, thereby influencing the sediment balance. Therefore, the permits were analysed for the area of interest.

Subsequently, the information gathered from AIS data and extraction permits were combined, resulting in estimates of volumes that are dredged in the study area. In addition, conversations with stakeholders were of valuable insight to confirm the results. 

\section{Field study}
In the fourth week of the project the field work took place. The goal of the field work was to obtain data from measurements on the boat using different devices, as well as obtaining resourceful information from chosen stakeholders in the area of the field work. This data would then be filtered, analysed and used to take conclusions from our initial hypothesis's regarding the study.

The field work divided the group of six students in two, leaving one group of three on the boat with our supervisor of INA to take the required measurements, and one group of three with another colleague of INA for the interviews.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
In this study, a qualitative research was conducted to explore perceptions and experiences related to the river. For this, interviews were conducted to capture insights from participants with diverse perspectives.

A qualitative approach was chosen because it allows for a detailed understanding of participants’ views and interpretations of the river. This design is particularly suited to capture the complexity of social and environmental issues, and to highlight the ways in which different stakeholders experience and assign meaning to the river.

Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, a method that combines prepared guiding questions with the flexibility to follow up on unexpected but relevant topics raised by participants. This format ensured that key themes were consistently addressed across interviews, while also allowing interviewees to elaborate on issues they considered important. In practice, a topic guide with questions per stakeholders was developed to provide structure, but the interviewer encouraged open-ended responses and probed further where clarification or depth was needed. Ten interviews were conducted. During the interview, responses were written down in key words. The questions along with these unfiltered results are given in the Appendix \ref{chap:interviewres}.

On Wednesday, the 24th of September, interviews were conducted with the caretaker at the local Fisher's club (Club de Pescadores Olivos), the portmanager at Puerto Ibicuy, the Mayor of Ibicuy and a landowner in the area of Ibicuy. The caretaker and landowner we showed multiple erosion banks around the river. On Thursday the 25th of September, interviews with the Municipality of Zarate, a local sand miner and a camping owner were carried out. The local sand miner showed the mining process on his boat and in the port and the land owner showed their land. On this day, several drone images were also made. Finally, on Friday the 26th of September, the plant manager of the YPF dry sand mine and another person from the municipality of Zarate were interviewed. 

Most of the stakeholders do not speak English, which is why colleagues Marina and Martin from INA have translated the questions and responses for us. Most stakeholders were approached on site. The port manager and the mayor had already been contacted in advance. After each interview, permission was asked to quote and name the stakeholder in the report. All stakeholders have agreed to this and were willing to share their experiences. The following table represents the interviews in a scheduled manner.

\section{Field measurements}
The goal of the field work was to obtain data from four different critical points in the study area indicated in red, as shown below in Figure 4.2, as useful as possible for establishing the sediment balance. Once this data was gathered, was analysed and weighed against the previous obtained data to draw conclusions. 
In this subsection the type of measurements will be explained, followed by indicative figures to accentuate the narrative.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/ch4/Critical measurement points.png}
    \caption{Critical Cross Section Measurements}
    \label{fig:fieldwork cross sections}
\end{figure}
During the field trip, one half of the group worked together with the INA team of employees who joined us. The team consists of one skipper who was responsible for driving of the boat and one supervisor who helped us with taking the measurements of the data.
The program of the boat days consisted of going over the indicated critical cross sections (in red on Figure 4.2) a total of 4 times, using the equipment of INA to save the necessary information of the river. 

\subsubsection{Flow velocity}
The first and most important measure is the flow velocity profile of the river, which the group has measured at the given cross section locations with the Sontek M9 machine of INA. This device consists of two components both placed on a floating board held next to the boat while advancing. The components are a vertical acoustic echo sounder beam placed on the back end of the floating board, and a rectangle shape box containing a microprocessor computing the data on the front end of the board, as seen on Figure 4.3.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=7cm]{figures/ch4/sonteknico.jpg}
        \caption{INA supervisors helping with measurement material}

    \hfill

        \label{fig:sontek}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Sontek M9 flow velocity device pictures}
    \label{fig:measurement}
\end{figure}

The speciality of the Sontek M9 is that it uses multiple acoustic frequencies to find a high resolution range of depths and flow velocities, while still tracking the geo-referenced position of the vessel using GNSS.  
The flow velocity is the speed of the river in a certain direction. The unit is therefore  [m/s], and is expressed in the form of a vector. 

The significance of this data is also due to the fact that the velocity is needed to compute the discharge as well.

\subsubsection{Discharge}
Once the velocity \(\mathbf{v}\) is found, it can be integrated over the depth and the width of the channel (through a cross-section) which in the end yields the discharge \(Q\) of the river at a given location, with a unit of \si{\cubic\metre}/s.
\begin{equation}
    Q = \iint_A \mathbf{v} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
    \label{eq:discharge_integration}
\end{equation}

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(Q\) is the discharge, expressed in cubic meters per second [m\textsuperscript{3}/s];
    \item \(\mathbf{v}\) is the flow velocity vector, expressed in meters per second [m/s];
    \item \(A\) is the cross-sectional area of the flow, expressed in square meters [m\textsuperscript{2}];
    \item \(d\mathbf{A}\) is an infinitesimal area element.
\end{itemize}

The aim of the field work was to obtain the data of flow velocity and discharge at the three critical points around the bifurcation of interest during different times, one in the morning and in the afternoon. Consequently this would indicate some changes in discharge for different times, flows, circumstances hence solidifying our data base of examples. 

\subsubsection{Suspended sediment}
Moving on, it is also in our interest to gather data on the suspended sediment of the river. This is done through the capture of water with the help of an APEMA BS6A pump connected to plastic bottles. One lowers a system to a certain dept which then pumps the sediment included water to the pump and stores it in a water bottle.
These plastic bottles contained the captured water of the river which were sealed in order to be sent to the water quality lab in the hydraulic section on the INA site, as seen in the Figures below.

These samples help to indicate the concentration of sediment in the channel, at different locations. In theory, since it was done at different levels of the river, it could potentially indicate a change in concentration from one point upper at Ibicuy to Brazo Largo in the southern, lower part of the study area. From this data, the group could draw even further conclusions.

\subsubsection{Bed load}
Moreover, the bed load was a necessary measurement for our analysis. The method used for this parameter is scraping the bottom layer of the channel with a metal shaped container.
The strategy for this measurement is tying a rope to the metal container, dropping it until it reaches the maximum depth of the location. Then, with help of the current or the boat, the person who holds the rope drags the container along with the horizontal movement which gradually collects sediment from the surface. Once this is done, the rope and the container are pulled up and restored in the boat. The last step is to take out some sediment and put it in a plastic bag.  Later on, the captured sediment was sent to the lab where the soil was dried out to find the components, quality and other parameters of the soil such as porosity which would add up to our results.
The metal container, as well as the extracts of the sediment samples in the oven are shown below in Figure 4.5.

\subsubsection{Bathymetry}
Using the echosounder, one will establish the depth of the channel at the position of the boat on a given timestep. Moving over the whole width of the channel yields the longitudinal profile.

\section{Setting up the Sediment Balance}
Using the flow velocity we can derive the concentration of the sediment in the study area. This can be done for several locations in order to get an idea of the quantities of sediment that come in through the Rio Ibicuy. Then the last critical point will help us determine the continuation of the concentration of the sediment in the Rio Parana so that any inconsistencies can be linked with the amount of extracted sand in the intersection of the Parana Guazu and Rio Talabera (in the middle of the three critical points on the right hand side of Figure 4.2).

A mathematical expression/derivation will be explained:

\section{Multidisciplinary approach}
The aim of this report is to present a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of sand mining in the Paraná River. To capture the full scope of the issue, a multidisciplinary approach is adopted. Accordingly, the impacts of sand mining are examined from several perspectives, reflecting the expertise of the authors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hydraulic}: assessment of the sediment balance and future river flow projections.
    \item \textbf{Geotechnical}: evaluation of risks to riverbank stability and identification of possible mitigation measures.
    \item \textbf{Structural}: analysis of potential effects on infrastructure, along with consideration of structural measures such as quay walls or stone revetments.
\end{itemize}
