\label{chapter:stakeholders}

In this part of the report, the stakeholders related to Rio Paraná Guazú will be explained. The goal of this stakeholder analysis is to understand the different interests in the region related to sand dredging activities.
\section{Dredgers (LOCAL??)}
The first dominant group of stakeholders are the dredgers.These include the local boats used in the area to extract sand and gravel from the river. There are several different types of dredgers ranging from small independent boats, to groups of small boats that work for the same employer (ARENEROS??), or big extracting ships commonly referred to as 'hoppers'. In the area of interest, the Paraná Guazú from Ibicuy to Brazo Largo, the most common dredgers are: (ARENEROS, INDEPENDENT BOATS). 

Currently there are 2 active boats in the zone of the Rio Paraná Guazú of interest, and (QUITE A LOT MORE IN IBICUY?? FROM INTERVIEW), as mentioned in the previous Chapter. (DREDGING ACTIVITY AANGEVEN WELKE BOTEN, MAPS MET HEEN EN TERUG REIS, DATA , ETC)

Their interest in the Rio Paraná Guazú is to extract the sand in locations of the river that are shallow since they do not possess any technology to mine the sand from deep. Once this water mixed sand is lifted onto the boat, they transport it to the nearest ports, Ibicuy or Brazo Largo. They sell their sand to the highest bidder which can be for (PURPOSES FROM INTERVIEW).


\section{BIG Dredging Companies?}
because they buy the sand and employ the areneros?
The Dredging companies active in the Rio Paraná Guazú are :

\section{Ports}
In the researched area there are two strategic port locations that play a key role in the sand extraction. (of meer ports? waar gaat het zand naartoe behalve brazo largo? in de ibicuy zijn we niet zeker dat het zand daar naartoe gaat)

\section{Fishermen}
Fischermen is another stakeholder group relevant for this study. The Rio Paraná Guazu is used by a lot of people for its high concentration of fish. 

The artisanal fisheries play an economic role as most of the harvest is sold to middlemen, freezing plants, or in informal markets. Of particular interest are long-range migratory species such as sábalo (Prochilodus lineatus), surubí (Pseudoplatystom corruscans, P. reticulatus), boga (Megaleporinus obtusidens), pacú (Piaractus mesopotamicus), and dorado (Salminus brasiliensis), that support artisanal, recreational, and subsistence fisheries, as observed in other large neotropical rivers, \autocite{assessment of sabalo}, \autocite{fishers' knowledge}

the fischermen in the region of interest are mostly independent. Even though there exists such thing as fischermen associations in the Rio Paraná Guazú, they are not influencial 



\section{NGO's}
even wachten tot ik een nice milieu organisatie vind.

\section{Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos}
Even wachten tot interview met hun, kijken of ze wel relevant zijn


\section{Filmmaker}

When researching for the stakeholders which were relevant for the analysis. We stumble upon an article on a film that was made on the Parana-Paraguay waterway. In this documentary, the focus is on the impact of the trade happening on the Parana-Paraguay waterway. The documentary is made by filmmaker Alejo Di Risio, who was contacted through journalist Matias Avramow for any additional information about stakeholders and business related to the waterway.
