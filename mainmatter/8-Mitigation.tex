\chapter{Mitigation Strategies}
\label{chap:mitigationstrats}

In this Chapter 'Mitigation Strategies' solutions to the discovered problems are described. In the first instance, one will illustrate the structural solutions for bank erosion. Moving on to different strategies, the choice was made to investigate how Nature-based solutions could be implemented. On the one hand, the principle of Nature-based solution was applied to mitigating the impact of dry sand mining. On the other hand, it was applied to mitigate the impact of river sand mining, thus looking at bank erosion once again. 

\section{Structural Solutions for Bank Erosion}
\label{section_8.2}

Several retaining structures that can be used to stabilize the river banks. Possibilities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sheet pile wall\\
    Sheet pile walls are a common retaining structure and consist of vertical barriers made of interlocking sections. They are a lightweight option and can be removed, which makes them reusable across multiple projects. Another advantage is the fact that installation is relatively easy and therefore cheap. However, sheet pile walls also have limitations. In hard soils and soils with boulders or cobbles, installation becomes difficult. Further, installation can disturb nearby areas through sounds and vibrations. These vibrations can even cause settlements to occur \autocite{korffReaderDeepExcavations2023}.

    \item Diaphragm wall\\
    Diaphragm walls are deep, reinforced concrete retaining structures. They provide excellent structural stability and are capable of resisting significant lateral soil and water pressures. One of their key advantages is water tightness, as they effectively prevent groundwater seepage. They are also suitable for a wide range of soil conditions, and offer durability due to the use of reinforced concrete. On the downside, they are costly to build and require significant time and space due to the specialized equipment, skilled labor, and extensive excavation work that is needed \autocite{korffReaderDeepExcavations2023}.
    
    \item Precast concrete wall\\
    Precast concrete walls are constructed by manufacturing structural elements in a factory environment before transporting them to the construction site. This process allows for superior quality control. Moreover, precast construction can significantly speed up project timelines, as elements are produced in large quantities and quickly installed on-site. Precast concrete offers a long service life with minimal maintenance. Drawbacks of precast concrete walls include: the elements are heavy and thus require specialized transportation and installation equipment \autocite{mcneilengineeringAdvantagesDisadvantagesUsing2023}. Further, the production and transport processes have notable environmental impacts, and repairs or replacements can be complex and costly.

    \item Auger pile wall or soldier pile wall\\
    Auger pile walls and soldier pile walls are widely used in construction for retaining slopes. Auger pile walls are formed by drilling and casting concrete in place, while soldier pile walls consist of vertical steel or timber H-piles with horizontal boards or panels placed between them. They are generally cost-effective solutions that generate minimal vibrations, making them suitable for urban areas and sites sensitive to noise or disturbance. Both systems offer flexibility, allowing adjustments to pile placement, size, and depth to suit specific project requirements. However, leakage between adjacent piles is a relevant risk when it comes to these types of walls \autocite{korffReaderDeepExcavations2023}. Maintaining proper overlap between piles is also critical to ensure structural stability and continuity of the wall.
\end{itemize}

In Table \ref{tab:compstruct}, the different structural solutions are summarized and are scored on different relevant criteria.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of structural solutions}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{lcccccccc}
\hline
Method & Installation & Price & Resistance & Versatility & Disturbance & Water tightness & Durability & Sustainability \\

Diaphragm wall  & -- & -- & ++ & ++ & + & ++ & ++ & - \\

Auger/Soldier pile wall & + & ++ & 0 & + & ++ & -- & - & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}%
}
\label{tab:compstruct}
\end{table}

As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:compstruct}, pile walls score low on water tightness and durability. The area of interest is located in a delta and hence high groundwater levels are to be expected. Therefore, water tightness must be guaranteed. Since the pile walls don't offer this certainty, this option is not further discussed. The diaphragm wall, on the other hand, offers great water tightness but installation is a far bigger challenge for this method. The benefits that the diaphragm wall offers, great resistance and low disturbance being the most relevant ones, do not outweigh the cons: the large amounts of time, space and budget needed to construct them. The same is true for the precast concrete wall: the heavy elements ask for a specialized and expensive installation procedure. The specialized equipment and experience is possibly not available or expensive, which means the precast concrete walls are not a viable option.

As a structural solution, the sheet pile walls are chosen. These elements score high on ease of installation and sustainability (parts can be removed and reused) and price, resistance and durability are also pros of this method. Disturbance is one of the main concerns related to sheet pile walls, but since the area of interest is in a scarcely populated area, this is not necessarily problematic. Another concern is the low versatility: installation is only possible if soils are not too hard. However, since installation will be executed in a delta with relatively soft soil (see xx), this should not be a major concern for this project.

\subsection{Sheet Pile Wall}
\label{section:sheet_pile_wall}

Sheet pile walls are frequently used in practices for application like excavations, waterfront structures, highway structures, flood protections schemes and bridge abutments. Steel sheet pile walls are mostly used as the high variety of combinations and the various profiles achieve the high moments of resistance while still maintaining the structural requirements of the design. In addition, the engineering advantages are in line with their suitability for water use, favorable ratio of steel cross section and moment of resistance and fast progress on site, which including their functionality and economical benefits is making their use favorable (Handbook).

\subsubsection{Cantilever and anchored}

The types of steel sheet pile walls which are most used in practice are the cantilever walls and anchored walls. Cantilever walls are mostly used as flood walls or earth retaining walls with heights of 3 to 5 meters. They are getting their support reactions from the ground and foundation soils and can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sheetpiles}. The anchored walls can be used when the heights of cantilever walls are exceeded or when the design should be based on lateral deflections. However, within this design the horizontal distance which will be required for the installation should be considered and and configuration can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sheetpiles} (EM-1110).

\subsubsection{Materials}

Sheet pile walls can be made of multiple materials, like steel, concrete, or wood. In this report, steel sheet pile walls will be used as advantages of this material outweighs the disadvantages and is more suitable than concrete or wood. As concrete will have a long service live, however, it will have high initial costs compared to steel and the installation of concrete walls is more difficult in relation to steel ones. In addition, wood walls, can only be used for short heights and will only be used for temporary structures. Like discussed in Section \ref{section_8.2} the advantages of steel piles and making it therefore the most common material used is the strength, light weight and long service life, in combination with the favorable ratio of cross-section and moment of resistance (EM-1110).

\subsubsection{Sections and interlocks}

For steel sheet pile walls, the sections and interlocks are of importance to make a complete wall which can be used for the application of waterfront structures. Figure \ref{fig:sections_sheetpiles} shows typical steel sections widely used and are known by the names of U and Z sections. In this figure the interlocks, which gives the sections its strength can also be seen. While the interlocks of the U sections are on the neutral axis, the ones for the Z sections are not. The maximum shear stress, can be obtained in the neutral axis, which makes the interlocks should be welded or crimped to obtain the full moment of resistance. When walls are in touch with water, and the walls need to be watertight, materials to fill up the interlocks like plastic compounds or the use of a preformed polyurethane interlock seal can be taken into considerations.

\subsubsection{Steel properties}

As steel will be the material used for the sheet piles the properties of steel, as being a homogeneous material will be touched on. Steel is an elastic material and has a favorable strength to weight ratio while characterizing the a range of 300 $N/mm^{2}$ to 2000 $N/mm^{2}$ for the tensile strength of this material. 

The stress-strain behavior of steel can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:stress_strain_steel}. The range of elasticity is depending on the grade of the steel and the elastic modulus for steel is 210000 $N/mm^{2}$. In Figure \ref{fig:stress_strain_steel}, $f_{y}$ is characterized as the yield strength which is the value where the stress will be constant or drop or go to a strain of 0.2\% when the load is taken away. Furthermore, $f_{u}$, is the tensile strength which is in line with the steel grade (Handbook). The mechanical properties of steel grades which are used for sheet piles are shown in Table \ref{tab:steel_materialproperties}.

\textit{Hot-rolled steel}

Steel sheet piles are made of hot rolled sections, which is the process of heating the steel to temperatures of over 900 $^{\circ}$C, before rolling which allows for the various shape and sizes what is of importance with sheet piles. Hot rolled sections are having slightly rougher surface when comparing it to cold rolled sections (BuyABeam).

\textit{Sustainability}

In Table \ref{tab:env_impacts}, an overview is given for the materials, concrete, steel and timber, in ralation of the CO2 emmisions and the energy consumption. As can be seen from the table, the production and use of steel as a material is not the most sustainable material for the usage for construction. However, as the choice is made of steel as the best option regarding the advantages of the profile and the fast installation of it research has to be done to check the most sustainable options for the steel sheet piles. 

\begin{table}[H]

With the knowledge of this sustainable solutions are in need and this is what is in line with the EPD ‘EcoSheetPiles™ Plus’ from ArcelorMittal. These sheet piles are produced on the electric arc furnace which means that in this proces 100\% of renewable electricity is used and 100\% of scrapped steel is being used for the production. In comparison to the blast furnace, the production of CO2 gasses is significantly reduced which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:eaf_bof}.

\subsection{Design of Sheet Pile Wall}

To design the steel sheet pile wall, first the critical location and a problem description should be identified to get a better understanding of the situation. After defining the conditions, a method should be considered to calculate the earth pressure and water pressure to later balance the moments to iteratively define the depth of the sheet pile wall. The sheet pile wall with the retaining height and embedded depth will after be verified based on the structural verifications including bending moments, shear force, and deflection of the wall. 

For the design of the sheet pile wall, the loads acting on the pile wall will be of high importance. In this case, the soil and hydraulic pressure should be defined and to be able to calculate what the acting forces on the structure will be. The soil parameters are defined and the soil profile is taken from Section \ref{par:geology}. With the soil profile and its parameters, the earth pressures will be defined on both sides of the sheet pile wall. For the hydraulic pressure, the water levels are of importance and these are taken from Section XX. 

% HIER EEN MOOI VERHAAL OVER HOE EEN SHEET PILE WALL DESIGN TOT STAND KOMT. 

With the problem description sketched a plan for the design of the calculation of the sheet pile can be set. The plan will be used for the verification of the sheet pile. The steps within the plan are taken from the CUR which is shown in Appendix XX.

\subsubsection{Design location}

The determination of the critical erosion points along the river has been done in Section \ref{section:cirtical_location}. The location which is analyzed here will also be the critical location where the design of the steel sheet pile will be based on. In Figure \ref{fig:critical_location}, the critical point in shown in Aqua Monitor and during the field trip images have been made to verify if the critical location of the Aqua Monitor map was visible. The total length of this location is 215 meters, which is drawn and shown in Table \ref{tab:Surface Lost Camping La Blanqueada in 2022} of Section \ref{section:cirtical_location}.

\subsubsection{Cross-section}

For the design of sheet pile wall in this section, the cantilever sheet pile wall will be used. As briefly touched on in Section \ref{section:sheet_pile_wall} the cantilever sheet pile is used for retaining heights up to 5 meters and is getting the support from the ground layers. In Figure \ref{fig:problem_description_sheetpiles}, an sketch of the situation is given. The height which need to be retained in indicated with Z. The embedment depth of the cantilever sheet pile which will need to be determined iterative, is noted as t. In this sketch the ground water table is indicated by the dashed line and abbreviation GWT. The water level of the river is indicated as WL and is in this sketch indicated by WL, which is on the same level as the GWT.

\begin{itemize}

    \item Z = Retained height
    \item t = Embedding depth
    \item $Z_{1}$ = Unsaturated soil
    \item $Z_{2}$ = Saturated soil
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Calculation method}

For calculating the embedded depth of a sheet pile wall multiple design methods and models are established worldwide. The most common methods which are applicable for sheet pile walls are the following (Opmaak1):

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bishop
  \item Pressure bar (push up)
  \item PLAXIS (F.E.M)
  \item Blum-sheet pile wall
  \item Spring-supported beam
  \item Terzaghi
  \item Homberg
  \item Horizontal balance
  \item Bakker (PLAXIS)
  \item Piping en heaving
\end{itemize}

Looking at the Eurocode 7, a cantilever sheet pile has to be calculated based on the spring-supported beam method. However, because of the complexity, the sheet pile wall will be calculated based on the the simplified method of BLUM. This method is a simplified representation of the situation, however, the calculations will later be verified by the D-Sheet software of Deltares, in which the spring-supported beam method is integrated.

\textit{Blum-sheet pile wall}

The Blum method is a simplified method in which a graphical approach is used. On the right side of the sheet pile is the "Active" side and on the left side, under the dredge level, the "Passive" side is present. The simplification step can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:blum} and an additional resultant force is acting on the lowest point of the sheet pile. . In this method, a plastic development of the soil and water table level is assumed to be infinite stiff. To calculate the embeddings depth , the sum of moments around the lowest point of the sheet pile wall will be set to zero. From the balance of moments the depth can be calculated. However, as in this method no safety factors are taken into account, the depth will have to be multiplied by a factor of 1.2 (Opmaak1)

\subsubsection{Geotechnical parameters}

To be able to design the sheet pile, the soil layers along with their geotechnical parameters should be known. In Paragraph \ref{par:geology}, the geological background for the area of interest was given and this serves as the basis for deriving soil layers and parameters. The borehole in Figure \ref{fig:borehole} is deemed the most relevant source. The borehole shows a top layer with fine/medium sands. Below, clay/clayey sand can be found, and the bottom layer consists of medium sand. This is in accordance with the geological profile that was provided before in Figure \ref{fig:geolprofile}, which describes a transition from near-surface beach ridges, dunes, beach plains, and delta subaerial facies to deeper open estuaries and marine deposists. The top deposits help declare the presence of sandy deposits at the top of the borehole and the layers of clay/clayey sand below correspond to estuarine deposits. Finally, old marine/fluvial deposits were likely compacted and lead to the layer of medium sand found at the bottom of the borehole.

Because of the resemblance between the local borehole and the geological profile given before, the layering as shown in Figure \ref{fig:borehole} is deemed representative for the whole study area. Based on this layering the relevant parameters can be derived, the result is shown in Table \ref{tab:soil_layers}.

The parameters in Table \ref{tab:soil_layers} were derived from the Eurocode \autocite{stichtingkoninklijknederlandsnormalisatieinstituutNederlandseNormNEN2025}. Because of limited knowledge on soil characteristics, conservative estimates were made based on this code. In the borehole, no explicit information is given on the top fill layer. Therefore, conservative parameters were assumed based on typical values for organic topsoil.

\textit{Soil profile in cross-section}

As derived from the borehole and the overview in Table \ref{tab:soil_layers}, the soil profile with the specific layers is added to the cross-section of the problem. In Figure \ref{fig:soil_profile_cross_section} it can be seen that the geotechnical properties of each layers is displayed.

    \caption{Soil profile in the cross-section}
    \label{fig:soil_profile_cross_section}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Hydraulic parameters}

In addition to the geotechnical values and parameters, the design of the cantilever sheet pile wall is also based on the hydraulic parameters and values. As if a sheet pile wall is located in opens water or when having groundwater the hydrostatic pressure will be acting on both sides of the sheet pile wall. The water level of the river and the ground water can be of difference, and when this is the case an excess of hydrostatic pressure will be acting on the sheet pile. 

Apart from this, the water height of the river is of importance. This value was determined from taking the bathymetry cross section of the river at the critical location. In Figure XX, the bathymetry is shown and the corresponding value of the water height is X.

For the calculation, normally, multiple ULS combinations should be calculated and the most unfavorable one is governing. All the combinations are shown in detail in Appendix XX. However, for the following calculation the most unfavorable combination is taken and elaborated.

\subsubsection{Embedding depth}

To calculate the embedding depth of the sheet pile. The moments around the lowest point of the sheet pile should be set to zero. To make up the balance of moments, firstly the forces and pressures acting on the sheet pile should be defined. The horizontal pressure acting on the sheet pile are based on the earth pressure by the soil and the hydrostatic pressure by the water. Firstly, the earth pressures will be calculated where after the hydrostatic pressure will be calculated, which will later be described as forces.

The depth of the embedding can be calculated in multiple ways. One way is to give the depth an unknown parameter t and leave this unknown expressed in the pressure and forces, which later give an explicit formula where the depth in an unknown. This can therefore be calculated in the sum of moments with taking roots. However, another approach is to begin with an estimated depth and calculate what the sum of moments around the lowest point is. After an iterative solution can be used to make sure the depth is increasing while optimizing the moment balance to zero at the lowest part of the sheet pile. In this calculation for the depth of the sheet pile the second method is taken and a first estimation of the embeddings depth is taken. As from Figure \ref{fig:problem_description_sheetpiles} in the cross-section could be seen the first estimation of the embedment depth is taken as 6.0 meters.

\textit{Effective stress}

The horizontal pressure of the soil can be calculated based on the vertical effective stress. The effective stress in the soil can be calculated with Equation \ref{eq:effective_stress}. In which the effective stress is based on the weight of the soil and the unit weight $\gamma$, of each layer. If the soil layer is below the ground water table the saturated unit weight should be deducted from the unit weight, $\gamma - \gamma_{w}$. In Figure \ref{eq:effective_stress} the effective stress of both sides of the sheet pile can be seen. In Table XX in Appendix XX, the values of the effective stress are displayed.

\begin{equation}
    \sigma^{'}_{z} = z \cdot \gamma
    \label{eq:effective_stress}
\end{equation}

\textit{Earth pressure and force}

The pressure the sheet pile is feeling from the soil is the lateral earth pressure acting due to the soil. As above, the effective vertical stress has been calculated, from here the horizontal component of the stress distribution can be calculated.

Soil is largely dependent by the nature and the stresses differ as the vertical effective stress also differs along the profile of the layers. The earth pressure can be calculated with the use of Equation \ref{eq:earth_pressure}. In here the relation between the effective stress and the pressure coefficient $K_{\gamma}$ is shown. For the active and passive side, the coefficients $K_{a}$ and $K_{p}$ will be used.

\begin{equation}
    p_{ea,h,z} = z \cdot \gamma \cdot K_{\gamma}
    \label{eq:earth_pressure}
\end{equation}

For the active and passive earth coefficients the formula based by Coulomb can be used which are shown in Equations \ref{eq:K_gamma_a_k} and \ref{eq:K_gamma_p_k}. As in this calculation the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\delta$, which are the slope of the sheet pile, ground levels, and wall friction angle are equal to zero, one can make use of the simpler formulation by the equation which results in Equations \ref{eq:Ka_tan} and \ref{eq:Kp_tan}.

\begin{equation}
    K_{\gamma;a;k} =
    \frac{
        \cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi' + \alpha\right)
    }{
        \cos^{2}(\alpha)
        \left(
            1 +
            \sqrt{
                \frac{
                    \sin\!\left(\varphi' + \delta_{a;k}\right)
                    \sin\!\left(\varphi' - \beta_a\right)
                }{
                    \cos\!\left(\alpha - \delta_{a;k}\right)
                    \cos\!\left(\alpha + \beta_a\right)
                }
            }
        \right)^{2}
    }
    \label{eq:K_gamma_a_k}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    K_{\gamma;p;k} =
    \frac{
        \cos^{2}\!\left(\varphi' - \alpha\right)
    }{
        \cos^{2}(\alpha)
        \left(
            1 -
            \sqrt{
                \frac{
                    \sin\!\left(\varphi' - \delta_{p;rep}\right)
                    \sin\!\left(\varphi' + \beta_p\right)
                }{
                    \cos\!\left(\alpha - \delta_{p;k}\right)
                    \cos\!\left(\alpha + \beta_p\right)
                }
            }
        \right)^{2}
    }
    \label{eq:K_gamma_p_k}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    K_a = \tan^{2}\!\left(45^\circ - \frac{\varphi'}{2}\right)
    \label{eq:Ka_tan}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    K_p = \tan^{2}\!\left(45^\circ + \frac{\varphi'}{2}\right)
    \label{eq:Kp_tan}
\end{equation}

With the use of Table \ref{tab:soil_layers} in which all the soil parameters are including the effective angle of internal friction which is needed to calculate the coefficients for the different layers. In Table \ref{tab:layers_ka_kp} an overview of the active and passive coefficients for all the layers are shown.

In Figure \ref{fig:earth_pressure} an overview of the active and passive earth pressure acting on the sheet pile. However, when calculating the earth pressures it should be noted that on the interfaces of the soil layers the right coefficient is taken and multiplied with the effective stress $\sigma_{z}$. With the active and passive pressures acting on the sheet pile one can determine the horizontal forces. This horizontal force is calculated with Equation \ref{eq:earth_force} where the active or passive earth pressure is multiplied by the height of the layer. For triangular shapes it should be multiplied with a factor or $\frac{1}{2}$.

For determining the force, triangles and rectangle area are computed by the Python code and the corresponding forces are calculated. In Figure \ref{fig:earth_pressure} an overview of all the corresponding forces are shown. An overview of the segments and their corresponding values and point of application are shown in Table XX in Appendix XX.

\textit{Hydrostatic pressure and force}

The hydrostatic pressure $w$ is called the pore water pressure. In unconfined groundwater, the pore hydrostatic pressure at a depth z is calculated with the use of Equation \ref{eq:pore_water_pressure}.

\begin{equation}
    w = z \cdot \gamma_{w}
    \label{eq:pore_water_pressure}
\end{equation}

When there is an excess of hydrostatic pressure, which means that the water levels on both side of the sheet pile wall are not on the same level, the excess hydrostatic pressure will occur. The excess hydrostatic pressure can be calculated with Equation \ref{eq:excess_water_pressure}. In Figure \ref{fig:hydrostatic_excess_pressure} an overview of the hydrostatic water pressure and force is given.

\begin{equation}
    w_{u}(z) = w_{r}(z) - w_{l}(z) = h_{r}(z) \cdot \gamma_{w} - h_{l}(z) \cdot \gamma_{w}
    \label{eq:excess_water_pressure}

% \textit{Balance of Forces}

% \begin{equation}
%     \sum{F_{H}} = 0
%     \label{eq:balance_forces}
% \end{equation}

\textit{Bending moment}

The balance of moments around the lowest part of the sheet pile should be zero, Equation \ref{eq:moment}. In Figure \ref{fig:final_moments_balance} the point where the moment should be equal to O is indicated. In addition, also the forces acting due to both the earth and hydrostatic are shown. From the forces derived from the earth and hydrostatic pressure and the distance to the lowest point of the sheet pile the moments can be computed. 

\begin{equation}
    \sum{M_{t}} = 0
    \label{eq:moment}
\end{equation}

From Table \ref{tab:forces_arms_moments_now}, it can be seen that the balance of moments is not 0. Which means it needs to be iteratively calculated increasing the embeddings depth to check at which depth the moments is zero. After the iteration process which was done by the Python code the embedment depth is set to be 9.713 meters. In Table \ref{tab:forces_arms_moments_9713} the values of the forces and moments are shown and the resulting moment around point O is zero. For the safety factor, the Blum method says the found embedding depth should be mulitplied by a factor of 1.20, this results in the following depth:

\begin{equation}
    t = 1.20 \cdot 9.713 = 11.6 \ m

\textit{ULS and SLS}

For the calculation for the embedding depth safety factors concerning the ultimate limit state and serviceability limit state should be included. For the calculation, normally, multiple ULS combinations should be calculated and the most unfavorable one is governing. All the combinations are shown in detail in Appendix XX. However, for the following calculation the most unfavorable combination is taken and elaborated.

The most unfavorable combination is the Low Mean Water and the combination in Equation \ref{eq:uls_combinations}. The related safety factors are shown in Table XX in Appendix XX. The hydrostatic loads are variable and the earth pressures permanent. For the serviceability service state is taking all the safety factors 1.0. With these factors the final embedded depth is calculated $t = 10.196$ m as shown in Figure \ref{fig:uls_moments_balance}.

\begin{equation}
    ULS_{1}: A_{1} + {M_{1}}
    \label{eq:uls_combinations}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    t = 1.20 \cdot 10.196 = 12.2 \ m

\section{Nature-based Solutions}

When it comes to Nature-based solutions, the question arises what this definition means. A general definition of Nature based Solutions is;

\textit{“Nature-based Solutions are actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably
use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine
ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges
effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being,
ecosystem services, resilience and biodiversity benefits” \autocite{eiselinVerenigdeNatiesStemmen2022}}

Although the name may give a thought that it only concerns natural and biodiversity increasing ideas this is actually not the case. For example the impact of NBS on the local economies and communities is of an equal importance. When it comes to weighing the different NBS against each other this report will make use of the seven goals of the IUCN which must be achieved as good as possible. The seven goals are presented below;

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.50\linewidth]{figures/ThesevenNBSgoals.png}
    \caption{Seven goals for achieving a good NBS \autocite{.....}}
    \label{fig:7g}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Resistance against NBS}

Although NBS are widely known in the scientific world, most people have never heard of these solutions. So, when implementing a solution which can't be described as a classical solution, there is a big change of getting resistance from multiple stakeholders. Especially local communities are skeptical because the solution is less concrete than a classical solution would be. The business case of a NBS must of course also be solid. Without funding of the project, there will never be a change to realize it. That's why it's from great importance to have a solution which is both reachable and explainable to the stakeholders. 

\subsection{Implementing NBS in this project}

As stressed out before, there is a problem with riverbank erosion due to processes of the river. Besides that there are also several problems due to dry sand mining. To mitigate or even solve these problems, it is the group's intend to use a nature based solution. Therefore there are presented multiple possible solutions to create a long-lasting, sustainable riverbank which is made cost effective. These solutions are all graded from one to ten for the seven goals described in Figure \ref{fig:7g}. 


\section{Bed and bank protection measures}
The Paraná Delta, the end of the Paraná-Paraguay river wetland system, begins in the city of Diamante in Entre Ríos province. It stretches for 300 kilometres and covers some 2.3 million hectares. Dotted with islands, these wetlands are a source of ecosystem services such as flood and drought buffering, water purification, erosion control and coastal protection, climate regulation, as well as the provision of shelter, feeding and breeding sites for various wildlife species. It also provides resources including fish, foraging, timber, medicine, and materials for construction and clothing \autocite{hibaParanaRiverEcological2024}.

In recent years, wetlands have become increasingly important for another key reason: their role as allies against climate change. They improve the resilience of communities to its impacts, serve as natural barriers against floods and droughts, and also function as carbon sinks. Despite playing these important roles, these ecosystems remain under great threat from human action – it is estimated that globally, 85 percent of the wetlands that existed three centuries ago have been destroyed or drastically transformed \autocite{hibaParanaRiverEcological2024}.

%While significant strides are taken to implement nature-based solutions (NbS) against climate change challenges, it is important to note that NbS requires large volume of sand. Additionally, NbS may take time to have the desired effect. Thus in some cases, grey structures (i.e., concrete) may be necessary in the mean time to address challenges in the short- to medium-term. In the context of extreme heat and its impacts on cities, NbS will also be instrumental to promote building designs and materials that require neither concrete infrastructure nor sand (UNEP 2021b). Climate change induced pressures, such as temperature stress and precipitation, will also speed up the degradation of existing infrastructure and the need for upgrading or replacement https://www.unep.org/resources/report/sand-and-sustainability-10-strategic-recommendations-avert-crisis

This section seeks to propose and evaluate Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) that can effectively address the environmental and socio-economic consequences of dry sand mining. The analysis focuses on developing strategies that harness natural processes to restore degraded ecosystems, enhance landscape resilience, and promote sustainable resource management. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding, the potential advantages and limitations of each proposed NBS will be critically examined. Furthermore, this section will delineate the intended implementation framework, outlining the methodological approach and practical steps required to translate these solutions into effective, context-specific interventions.

\subsection{Floodplains}

Floodplains are low-lying areas around rivers that naturally flood during periods of high water discharge. When managed and restored appropriately, these zones play a crucial role in maintaining riverine ecosystem functions and mitigating the adverse impacts of human activities such as sand mining and land degradation.

In the context of dry sand mining, floodplains could be a Nature-Based Solution to counteract the degradation of terrestrial and hydrological systems resulting from excessive sand extraction. Dry sand mining frequently occurs in former floodplain areas or adjacent uplands, where the removal of surface materials disrupts soil structure, alters drainage patterns, and reduces the area’s natural capacity to retain water. Restoring and reactivating floodplains in such landscapes helps to re-establish the natural hydrological connectivity between surface and subsurface systems. This process promotes groundwater recharge, initiate soil sedimentation and mitigates erosion caused by wind and surface runoff. Moreover, re-vegetated floodplains provide new habitats for native species, contributing to the overall ecological recovery of mined areas. As such, floodplain restoration in dry sand mining zones supports landscape resilience, reduces the long-term environmental footprint of extraction activities, and facilitates a more sustainable post-mining land use.

Restored floodplains offer significant opportunities for local community engagement, livelihood diversification, and socio-economic development. Once stabilized and revegetated, these areas can be utilized for sustainable land uses such as flood-resilient agriculture, agroforestry, and controlled grazing, which maintain ecological functions while providing income for local populations. Additionally, floodplains can serve as sites for eco-tourism, recreation, and environmental education, fostering a stronger connection between communities and their natural surroundings. The enhancement of biodiversity and landscape aesthetics further increases the cultural and recreational value of these areas. Moreover, the restored floodplain’s role in improving water retention and soil fertility can directly support local food and water security, especially in regions affected by the environmental degradation of dry sand mining. Through community-based stewardship, floodplain restoration can therefore become a catalyst for sustainable rural development and long-term environmental resilience.

\subsection{}
The use of metal-tolerant plants, such as phytostabilizers and hyperaccumulators, represents an effective Nature-based Solution for mitigating contamination and surface runoff in areas affected by dry sand mining. These plant species have the capacity to absorb, immobilize, or stabilize pollutants, including heavy metals and chemical residues from washing processes, within their roots or above-ground tissues. By establishing vegetation on disturbed or contaminated soils, this method reduces the mobility of harmful substances, prevents their leaching into nearby water bodies, and enhances overall soil stability.
In addition to pollutant control, these plants help reduce surface runoff by increasing soil infiltration capacity and root cohesion, thereby minimizing erosion and the spread of sediments. Over time, the vegetative cover contributes to ecosystem recovery, transforming degraded mining landscapes into self-sustaining, biologically active systems.
Within the Paraná Delta, several naturally occurring plant species exhibit tolerance to moderate metal contamination, conditions which can be associated with post-mining sites. Examples include:

•	Phragmites australis (reed): known for high tolerance to heavy metals and ability to stabilize sediments \autocite{}.
•	Typha domingensis (southern cattail): native to wetlands in a delta; capable of uptaking and accumulating metals.
•	Schoenoplectus californicus (California bulrush): efficient in reducing nutrient and contaminant loads in water.
•	Spartina densiflora (cordgrass): salt- and metal-tolerant grass found along deltas and coastal zones.

These species are either native or naturalized in the Paraná Delta region and can therefore be used without compromising local biodiversity or ecological integrity. 



\subsection{Vegetated buffer zones}
Vegetated buffer zones are strips of land planted with dense vegetation, such as grasses, shrubs, and trees, established between areas of active land use (dry mining sites) and surrounding environments such as settlements, agricultural fields and nature. In the context of dry sand mining, these buffers function as a natural barrier that mitigates the spread of dust, noise, and pollutants generated by extraction activities.

From an ecological perspective, vegetated buffer zones play a vital role in stabilizing soil, reducing wind speed, and capturing airborne particles, thereby improving local air quality and minimizing off-site impacts. The root systems of the plants anchor the sandy substrate, preventing erosion and surface runoff, while the vegetation canopy traps dust and enhances microclimatic conditions by increasing humidity and reducing temperature fluctuations.

In addition to their environmental benefits, buffer zones contribute to biodiversity enhancement by creating transitional habitats that support a variety of species and small fauna. They also serve as visual and acoustic screens, reducing noise and improving the aesthetic quality of the landscape. When designed with native and drought-tolerant species, vegetated buffers require minimal maintenance and can thrive in the disturbed conditions typical of mining landscapes.

Moreover, the establishment of buffer zones can provide socio-economic advantages for local communities through community-based planting initiatives. Overall, vegetated buffer zones represent a cost-effective and multifunctional Nature-Based Solution that simultaneously addresses environmental degradation, air quality concerns, and landscape restoration in areas affected by dry sand mining.

\subsection{Implementation in Ibicuy area}

The area shown in Figure \ref{fig:PAI} includes the Cristamine S.A. sand mine (located an the right down corner) and another sand extraction site located just next to the primary school (Escuela Primaria). These mining activities have a strong influence on the surrounding landscape and local air quality. By changing the orange surrounded area into a floodplain and the blue lines into vegetated buffer zones these influences could be mitigated. 

The restoration approach by involving floodplains could be used between the area of primary school and the Cristamine mine, with the road as its boundary, as a floodplain restoration zone (orange area). This solution would be particularly valuable after mining operations have ended, allowing the area to naturally recover, increase biodiversity, and provide flood protection and water storage capacity.

In the shorter term, the vegetated buffer solution could effectively reduce dust emissions and protect the local community. Establishing dense vegetation, around the primary school would help minimize dust dispersion into the school grounds, improving air quality for the children and teachers.
Similarly, implementing vegetated buffers along the main road would limit dust movement caused by sand transportation, improving air quality, visibility and nuisance for nearby residents and road users.

From an economic feasibility perspective, these solutions are relatively cost-effective compared to large-scale engineering interventions. Vegetated buffers require moderate initial investment in planting and maintenance but offer long-term benefits in ecosystem services, reduced health costs, and improved landscape aesthetics. Floodplain restoration needs a bigger investment amount. This could be funded through mine closure obligations or environmental offsets, making it a sustainable and financially viable option for the area.

\section{Nature-based Solutions for bank erosion}
In this section, the NBS for the bank erosion, the biggest negative consequence and concern due to the river sand mining will be presented. 

\subsection{Natural Flood Management}
Natural Flood Management (NFM) is a NBS that consists of using natural materials to slow the flow of water through the land and reduce the chance of flash flooding, as well as increasing water storage throughout the landscape \autocite{therivertrust5EasyWays}. Using NFM upstream means that water takes a lot longer to reach lowlands and downstream areas. 

A number of techniques are used in NFM, such as:

Leaky dams – placing a series of logs across a watercourse mimics the effect of naturally fallen trees. Whilst it’s important not to block the water completely, slowing the flow eases pressure downstream and reduces the risk of flooding, especially after heavy rain.

\subsubsection{Mangrove}
– If the right trees are planted in the right places, woodland creation can go a long way towards managing the flow of water through river catchments. Leaves intercept rainwater and soak some of it up, which slows the rate at which the rain hits the ground and enters rivers. Below ground, tree roots help to bind soil together, reducing the amount of sediment which runs off into watercourse.

Making space for storing water – Features such as ponds and wetlands can store a vast amount of water which would otherwise rush through catchments as surface water. As the water passes through the wetland or pond, it is naturally filtered, often leading to lower levels of harmful pollutants. What’s more, filling the pond or wetland with native plant species encourages wildlife and provides health and wellbeing benefits too.
