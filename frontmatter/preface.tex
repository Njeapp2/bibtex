The Multi Disciplinary Project is an initiative of ten weeks from the Technical University of Delft where a group of six students with different specializations join forces to work together on a project. These projects are linked with an external party for whom students create a design or conduct a study on a certain topic. In this case, the work contributes to the sediment balance of the Paraná Guazú River, in collaboration with the National Institute of Water (INA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

In name of the group, we express our gratitude to the INA staff who have guided us throughout this project, in particular Eng. Martin Sarabots Gerbec, Dr. Eng. Mariano Re, Eng. Leandro Kazimierski, as well as our supervisors from the TU Delft, Dr. Ir. Anne Baar and Dr. Ir. Wout Broere.
