The Multi Disciplinary Project is an initiative of ten weeks from the Technical University of Delft where a group of six students with different specializations join forces to work together on a project. These projects are linked with an external party for whom students create a design or conduct a study on a certain topic. In this case, the work contributes to the knowledge on sand mining in the lower Paran√° delta, in collaboration with the National Institute of Water (INA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

In name of the group, we express our gratitude to our INA supervisors who have guided us throughout this project: Eng. Martin Sarabots Gerbec, Dr. Eng. Mariano Re, and Eng. Leandro Kazimierski. We would also like to thank Nicolas for his help during the fieldwork and Marina Sarti for everything she has done for us, both on and off the project. Finally, we want to thank our supervisors from TU Delft for their guidance: Dr. Ir. Anne Baar and Dr. Ir. Wout Broere, and all interviewed stakeholders who made this work possible.
