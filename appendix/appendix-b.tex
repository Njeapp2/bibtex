\section{Reflection}
Note:  Each MDP group must submit a reflection report to their supervisors. As the manual mentions, the report describes how the group was organized, including the task division, the collaboration with the client(s), supervisors, and stakeholders, the cohesion of different disciplines (multi-disciplinarity), the fulfillment of deadlines, and the integration into clientâ€™s working environment. In addition, the reflection report describes how the group members experienced the team process

\section{Task Division}

Throughout the ten weeks of the project every student of the MDP385 Group has actively contributed to the project. 
The contributions have been allocated to one of several students per Chapter in the Report. This can be seen in the Table below.
