  abstract = {The Parana River Delta (close to Buenos Aires, Argentina) shows a continuous growth, fed by relatively fine sediments supplied from the upper basin. The rate of advancement of the Delta Front reaches several tens of meters per year in the most active zones, along its 60 km frontline. This process has significant economic consequences. In the context of Climate Change, projections on its future trends constitute important information that may help for land use management and planning. Mathematical modeling of the Delta Front advancement, validated using recent satellite imagery and cartographic data, is proposed as an appropriate tool for assessing future trends of the system evolution under various scenarios. Improving upon previously published modeling studies, the current methodology is based on the hydrodynamic modeling of the frontal area, solving the shallow water equations, and a coupled transport model for suspended sediments, which includes advection, diffusion, deposition and resuspension. The bottom and coastal morphology changes are also accounted for in a coupled fashion. The hydrodynamic model is validated through comparison between calculated and measured currents.The validation of the hydro-sedimentologic-morphologic model, as awhole, is performed by comparing the simulated and observed front advancement for the 1994-2007 period. Future scenarios related to Climate Change are evaluated, including variations in the hydrodynamics conditions (mean sea level) and sediment yield.}

  abstract = {The La Plata Basin is the second largest drainage basin in South America. The Paran{\'a} River, the basin's main river, discharges into the R{\'i}o de la Plata estuary in Argentina. In the Lower Paran{\'a} Delta, near the deltaic front, a complex system of mostly natural and some man-made channels redistribute a part of the river flow. Like the river and the estuary, the channel network has been subject to sediment deposition, limiting the navigability needed for the small-scale transport of goods, leading to hindrance to tourism and other economic activities in the Lower Delta. Compared to the river system on the large scale, not much is known about the characteristics and the morphodynamic behaviour of the channel network. The objective of this research is to set a first step in providing insight on the relevant processes and human activities that influence morphology changes in the Lower Delta channel network. {$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}Making use of existing data, a literature study and data obtained during several field surveys, various hypotheses were formulated. Hypotheses included the potential influence of land use change in the catchment and climate change related trends in precipitation patterns, climatic variability associated with El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation, the effect of artificially deepening one of the two main branches of the Paran{\'a} River and the excavation of artificial channels in the Lower Delta in the early twentieth century. The effects of said processes and human activities are tested with a scenario-based hydrodynamic modelling study, making use of Delft3D Flexible Mesh with sediment transport and morphology modules.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}Our analysis provided various insights in the behaviour of the Lower Delta channel network, and the influence of human activities and natural processes on this behaviour. A notable finding is that artificial deepening of the Paran{\'a} de Las Palmas by dredging its thalweg since 1990 has lead to a significant reduction in river flow entering channels supplied by the river branch and increased sedimentation rates in these channels. In addition, insight was gained on the spatial distribution of depositional and erosive patterns instigated by discharge and sediment input changes. {$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}This research has provided a first, global insight into the relevant processes governing channel morphodynamics. Some of the findings can serve as input for future dredging strategies, as results imply that the current strategy has lead to limitations to the navigability of an intensively navigated part of the channel network. Furthermore, the outcome of this research can serve as a starting point for research on one of the specific topics covered by the hypotheses, including but not limited to the influence of storm surges, the effect of a potential spatial heterogeneity in soil composition and the influence of tidal divides on morphological features in the channel network.{$<$}br/{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Mekong delta, in Vietnam, is the world's third largest delta. Densely populated, the delta has been significantly armoured with engineering works and dykes to protect populations and infrastructure from storms, and shrimp farms from saltwater intrusion. Considerable development pressures in Vietnam and in the upstream countries have resulted in the construction of several dams in China and in important channel-bed aggregate extractions especially in Cambodia. The effects of these developments impact the delta dynamics in various ways. In this study, changes in the channel morphology of the Mekong proper and the Bassac, the two main distributaries in the 250km-long deltaic reach from the Cambodian border to the coast, were analysed using channel depth data for 1998 and 2008. The channels display important and irregular bed changes over the 10-year comparison period, including significant incision and expansion and deepening of numerous pools. The mean depth of both channels increased by more than 1.3m. Both channels also showed correlative significant bed material losses: respectively 90millionm3 in the Mekong and 110millionm3 in the Bassac over the 10-year period. These important losses over a relatively short period, and weak correlations between bed incision and hydraulic parameters suggest that the marked morphological changes are not in equilibrium with flow and sediment entrainment conditions, and are therefore not related to changes in river hydrology. We claim that aggregate extraction, currently practised on a very large scale in the Mekong delta channels and upstream of the delta, is the main cause of these recent morphological changes. These changes are deemed to contribute actively to rampant bank erosion in the delta as well as to erosion of the Mekong delta shoreline. Other contributory activities include the numerous dykes and embankments. The role of existing dams in bed losses remains unclear in the absence of reliable data on the Mekong sediment load. Future large-scale hydropower dam development on the Lower Mekong main stem will have cumulative effects with aggregate extraction, leading to increased morphological changes that will further impact the delta, especially in terms of sediment supply and coastal erosion.},

The coastal plains and surrounding areas in the south of Entre R{\'i}os Province together with the Paran{\'a} delta represent the innermost environments of the R{\'i}o de la Plata that were affected by the late Pleistocene-Holocene post-glacial transgression. Thus, they evolved in the context of the evolution of the entire R{\'i}o de La Plata as a result of the combined effect of relative sea-level rise and fall, the coastal dynamic in the former littoral environments, climatic changes and substrate topography. The sedimentary record consists of a sequence of estuarine deposits, resulting from migration of a muddy depocentre during the transgression, underlying deposits representing beach-ridges, plains, dunes, low-energy beaches and deltas that evolved during the regressive event. These sediments respectively constitute two system tracts, transgressive and highstand, which are part of the sequences extended all along the entire La Plata river. There were three evolutionary stages. The first corresponds to the transition from transgression to highstand during times of higher temperature and humidity than at present, when the estuarine depocenter that had previously invaded the La Plata river reached its innermost position; minor deltas developed at the mouths of small rivers and beach ridges systems began to form. The second represents the first part of the highstand when drier climatic conditions prevailed, resulting in the interruption of progradation of small deltas and replacement by estuarine beaches formed by littoral drift and formation of dunes. The last stage elapsed from the moment when climatic conditions became more humid as the present conditions developed, such that an increase in water supply from the Paran{\'a} river induced the formation of the Paran{\'a} delta and the consequent isolation of the former innermost estuarine and beach-ridges environments. Regional correlations supported by radiocarbon dating reveal a synchronism between geomorphological events and features in the study area and in the southern margin of the R{\'i}o de La Plata.},

  abstract = {In the ecological studies of the Amazon region, more attention has been paid to the aquatic systems than to the terrestrial ones. In particular, emphasis has focused on freshwater nutrients. It appeared from the outset that the waters of the region were chemically and physically very heterogeneous, and that in general, chemically poor waters predominated. The first classification of Amazonian freshwaters (Sioli 1950) was based mainly on optical characteristics, and distinguished blackwater, with a high content of humic compounds, whitewater, with a high content of suspended sediment, and clearwater, which is neither turbid with suspensoids or coloured by humic compounds. However, chemical analyses showed that in spite of the generally low levels of electrolytes, there were considerable differences in water chemistry between individual water bodies of a particular optical type (Sioli 1953, 1957a, 1968a). This was found to be the case particularly with the clearwaters (Sioli 1965a, 1968a). Thus the optical types could not be clearly separated on the basis of ionic composition. Differences in water chemistry were, however, closely linked with the geological, geochemical and petrographic properties of the source regions of the waters (Gibbs 1967; Sioli 1968a; Fittkau 1974). Markedly acid, electrolyte-poor waters arise in the highly weathered tertiary sediments which cover vast areas of the Central Amazonian lowlands (Sioli 1954b; Fittkau 1964, 1967; Schmidt 1972a; Furch 1976; Irion 1976; Stallard 1978; Furch \& Junk 1980; Stallard 1980).},

  abstract = {Alluvial bedforms are a first order control on flow resistance, water levels and rate of sediment transport. Their morphologies are a direct reflection of the hydraulic and sedimentological conditions under which they are formed. Studies of natural dunes in large river systems have shown that low angled dunes are dominant, characterized by reduced flow resistance and limited recirculation of flow in their lee-slopes. However, increasingly, alluvial rivers are influenced by human activities, such as sand extraction, that directly impact the morphologies of river beds and bedforms. Here, we present a comparison of the morphologies of natural and anthropogenically influenced bedforms observed through multibeam echo sounder surveys on the Mekong River in Cambodia. We show that anthropogenic bedforms have higher amplitudes ({$\mu$} = 2.8 m, {$\sigma$} = 1.0 m), steeper leeside angles ({$\mu$} = 20.6{$^\circ$}, {$\sigma$} = 5.8{$^\circ$}) and shorter wavelengths ({$\mu$} = 100.1 m, {$\sigma$} = 87.9 m) compared to natural dunes (amplitude: {$\mu$} = 1.79 m {$\sigma$} = 0.86 m, leeside angle: {$\mu$} = 11.8{$^\circ$} {$\sigma$} = 5.7{$^\circ$}, wavelength: {$\mu$} = 117.0 m, {$\sigma$} = 89.1 m). Our data suggests that the form roughness of anthropogenic bedforms is higher (median ksf = 1.23) than natural bedforms found in sections of the Mekong unaffected by mining (median ksf = 0.49). As a result, flow patterns subsequently force suspended load over bedforms, meaning sediment is unable to infill mining pits. Anthropogenic bedforms may represent a significant and previously under-represented control of flow and sediment transport in alluvial river systems.},

  abstract = {Empirically quantifying tidally-influenced river discharge is typically laborious, expensive, and subject to more uncertainty than estimation of upstream river discharge. The tidal stage-discharge relationship is not monotonic nor necessarily single-valued, so conventional stage-based river rating curves fail in the tidal zone. Herein, we propose an expanded rating curve method incorporating stage-rate-of-change to estimate river discharge under tidal influences across progressive, mixed, and standing waves. This simple and inexpensive method requires (1) stage from a pressure transducer, (2) flow direction from a tilt current meter, and (3) a series of ADP surveys at different flow rates for model calibration. The method was validated using excerpts from 12 tidal USGS gauging stations during baseflow conditions. USGS gauging stations model discharge using a different more complex and expensive method. Comparison of new and previous models resulted in good R2 correlations (min 0.62, mean 0.87 with S.D. 0.10, max 0.97). The method for modeling tidally-influenced discharge during baseflow conditions was applied de novo to eight intertidal stations in the Mission and Aransas Rivers, Texas, USA. In these same rivers, the model was further expanded to identify and estimate tidally-influenced stormflow discharges. The Mission and Aransas examples illustrated the potential scientific and management utility of the applied tidal rating curve method for isolating transient tidal influences and quantifying baseflow and storm discharges to sensitive coastal waters.},

In the United States these reservoirs are estimated to contain in-place gas resources of at least 420 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) and possibly more than 5,000 Tcf. Estimates of recoverable gas in the United States range from less than 200 to more than 550 Tcf. Tight gas reservoirs occur in nearly all petroleum provinces. They occur at virtually all depths and in a variety of rock types that include sandstone, siltstone, shale, sandy carbonate rocks, limestone, dolomite, and chalk. Tight gas reservoirs may be thick and areally extensive or thin and areally limited. In contrast to normal (conventional) gas accumulations where the gas is concentrated in structural or stratigraphic traps, gas in tight reservoirs occurs as regionally pervasive accumulations that are usually abnormally pressured and are mostly independent of structural and stratigraphic traps. Artificial stimulation, such as hydraulic fracturing, is usually needed in order to produce the gas unless extensive fracturing is present. As a consequence of an improved understanding of tight gas reservoirs and improved drilling and completion practices, gas from these reservoirs is rapidly emerging as a major source of energy. 64 refs., 17 figs., 1 tab.},

River dunes are causing shallow areas, so a better understanding of dune behavior can aid decision-making on dredging strategies. A new dune-tracking method was developed to analyze dunes after dredging. This knowledge was combined with information on dredging methods and intensity. This enables the analysis of dune development after dredging and the assessment of the impact of dredging methods such as topping (removing sediment from the crest) and swiping (transferring sediment from the crest to the trough). The results show that dredging increases the growth rate of dunes, especially when the discharge increases after dredging. For the studied dredging intensities, topping has a more pronounced effect than swiping on the immediate reduction of dune height. The changes in dune heights due to dredging are within the natural dune height variability. In the long term, topped dunes exhibit larger growth rates than those undergoing swiping. So dredging does have an effect on dune dynamics, in particular on the dune height growth rates.},

  abstract = {The Paran{\'a} River is one of the world's largest fluvial systems due to its discharge. During the last 30 years, water discharge has averaged 18,389~m3~s-1 downstream of the Paraguay-Paran{\'a} confluence, where its most important tributaries, the Paraguay and the upper Paran{\'a} rivers contribute 22\% and 78\% of its total discharge, respectively. However, the sedimentological dynamics of this system behaves peculiarly due to the influence of the Bermejo River, a tributary of the Paraguay River. Even though the contribution of the Bermejo River discharge represents only 2\% of the Paran{\'a} River discharge, its input of suspended sediments is significant due to the erosive processes in the upper Bermejo basin. Most earlier studies have primarily focused on the contributions and dynamics of the wash load (silt and clay) from the Bermejo River through the Paraguay River to the Paran{\'a} River, and neglected the relevance of fine and very fine sands (coarser than 63~{$\mu$}m). These sediment fractions play a key role in bed sediment composition, roughness, and bed forms, ultimately modifying the flow resistance and the morphodynamic processes, among other environmental and biological parameters. This study seeks to quantify the suspended sediment contribution of the main tributaries of the middle Paran{\'a} River during the last three decades. In particular, water discharge, sediment transport and grain size data measured at gage stations located at the Paraguay River upper reach, the Bermejo River, and the upper and middle reaches of the Paran{\'a} River are analyzed. Focus is placed on the coarse suspended sediment fraction. Additionally, the authors collected sediment samples at different river cross-sections and water discharges. The temporal analysis revealed the dynamic behavior of the sediments along the system. The results show different behaviors of the wash load and suspended sand transport provided by the Bermejo River. Along the middle Paran{\'a} reach, results suggest a significant suspended coarse fraction deposition during the highest sediment input period. Bed sediments, in turn, are re-suspended during the months with low contributions from the Bermejo and/or during the high water levels stages of the Paran{\'a}. This sediment dynamics produces a complex pattern of coarse sediment transport in the Paran{\'a} River at its middle reach, also modifying the sedimentological characteristics of the river bed.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the geological evolution of the Paran{\'a} River in Corrientes Province, located inside the Mesopotamic Argentine region, and reviews the principal geomorphological and hydro-sedimentological characteristics of this outstanding fluvial system. Active lateral migration of the Paran{\'a} River inside its large alluvial fan, which covers the north-western portion of Corrientes Province, reveals a structural control related to the separation and breakup of Gondwana. The lowlands now present in this region receive only pluvial input and constitute one of the largest wetlands in South America, the Esteros del Iber{\'a}. The best exposed geological units in Corrientes Province are the Ituzaing{\'o} Formation (Plio-Pleistocene) that is a fluvial deposit associated with evolution of the Paran{\'a} River, and the Torop{\'i}-Yupo{\'i} Formation (Pleistocene), a younger palustrine fill generated by deposition of aeolian sediment over the underlying fluvial sands. The present planform pattern of the Paran{\'a} River in Corrientes Province is anabranching with several types of bar that occupy more than 30\% of the channel surface. The bed sediment is predominantly medium to fine sand with the dominant bedform being dunes, which thus also dominate its subsurface sedimentary architecture. The suspended sediment concentration of the Paran{\'a} River downstream from its confluence with the Paraguay River (its main tributary) is asymmetric across the channel width, with higher concentrations towards the west due to the much higher input of sediment from the Paraguay River, which in turn receives most of its suspended sediment from the Bermejo River. At Corrientes City, suspended sediment concentration shows extremes ranging from 1 to 616~mg~L-1 on the eastern margin and from 8 to 1271~mg~L-1 on the western margin. Mixing between the Paran{\'a} and Paraguay rivers flows may take more than 600~km downstream before full mixing is achieved, with the mixing processes at the junction being determined by the discharge (momentum) ratio between the two confluent rivers, topographically-driven flows and the possible influence of density driven underflows at their interface. The confluence area between the Paran{\'a} and Paraguay rivers is characterized by a large scour that is {$\sim$}30~m deep, with its deepest location being at the mouth of the Paraguay River where the channel narrows due to local bedrock control. Due to the different elevation of the Paran{\'a} River margins in the region downstream of the confluence, the contemporary floodplain is developed extensively only on the western margin. This floodplain can also be considered as proximal (flooded yearly) or distal (flooded only during extraordinary events) in its geomorphic character. Most of the headwaters of small tributaries in this part of the Paran{\'a} River basin are located in wetlands. In these wetlands, the channel beds are characterized by fine sediment consisting of silt and cohesive clays, and where the suspended sediment has a high proportion of organic matter.},

In long-term monitoring at 6 homes within 800m of sand mining activities, the highest daily mean PM concentrations observed were 14.5{$\mu$}g/m3 for PM2.5 and 37.3{$\mu$}g/m3 for PM10, although infrequent ({$<$}3\% of time), short-term elevated PM concentrations occurred when wind blew over the facility. In laboratory studies, aerosolized sand was shown to produce respirable-sized particles, containing 6\% to 19\% crystalline silica. Dispersion modeling of a mine and processing facility indicated that PM10 can exceed standards short distances ({$<$}40m) beyond property lines. Lastly, fence-line PM and crystalline silica concentrations reported to state agencies were substantially below regulatory or guideline values, although several excursions were observed for PM10 when winds blew over the facility.

  abstract = {The demand for construction-grade sand is growing at a tremendous rate and the world is expected to run out of this resource by 2050. Construction-grade sand, hereafter referred to as `sand', can be found in (former) aquatic environments, such as rivers and is a provisioning ecosystem service. Even under controlled circumstances, the practice of extracting the sand from the riverbed and -banks impacts the environment. Unfortunately, many countries lack sand mining regulation policies and in combination with a high demand, this results in indiscriminate and illegal mining. To create effective policies for sustainable extraction of river sand, there is a need for both qualitative and quantitative data on the effects of river sand mining. This paper brings together the effects of river sand mining on the physical, biological, chemical, and anthropogenic environment through a systematic literature review. The effects found are widespread and often cumulative. In the physical environment, the primary effects are riverbed widening and lowering. In the biological environment, the overarching effect is a reduced biodiversity and stretches from the aquatic and shoreline flora and fauna to the whole floodplain area. The effects on the chemical environment are a reduced water, air and soil quality through pollution. The effects on the anthropogenic environment comprise of damaged infrastructure, bad working circumstances for workers, limited access to water and agricultural losses. The findings of this research emphasize the complexity and cascading nature of the effects of river sand mining, as well as the severity and urgency of the problem. Based on the effects found and the four environments, a set of guidelines are proposed at the end of this paper to be used for global agenda making regarding sustainable sand extraction. Future research should prioritise quantifying the observed effects and developing science-based policies for sustainable mining.},

  abstract = {Rating curves relating stream discharge to water-surface stage are traditionally established empirically through many measurements of discharge and concurrent stage. However, discharge measurements typically scatter and do not show a unique relation to the stage because the underlying physics are usually not reflected in the rating. Examining the relationship of stage versus discharge in open channels based on the fundamental hydrodynamics of unsteady nonuniform flow identifies terms in the Saint-Venant equations that should considered in rating development. The Hydraulic Performance Graph, which provides a steady-state approximation to the hydrodynamics governing open-channel flow, provides a tool to develop theoretical ratings. Analysis of a hypothetical channel indicates that terms describing the pressure gradient, conveyance, and convective acceleration should be included to develop a rating that applies to the possible range of flow conditions.},

  abstract = {Thermal structure and water quality in a large and shallow lake in Malaysia were studied between January 2012 and June 2013 in order to understand variations in relation to water level fluctuations and in-stream mining activities. Environmental variables, namely temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, chlorophyll-A and transparency, were measured using a multi-parameter probe and a Secchi disk. Measurements of environmental variables were performed at 0.1~m intervals from the surface to the bottom of the lake during the dry and wet seasons. High water level and strong solar radiation increased temperature stratification. River discharges during the wet season, and unsustainable sand mining activities led to an increased turbidity exceeding 100~NTU, and reduced transparency, which changed the temperature variation and subsequently altered the water quality pattern.},

  abstract = {A precise and thorough understanding of tide-river interactions holds practical significance for estuarine management and the sustainable utilization of water resources, particularly in the context of saltwater intrusion. Previous research on tide-river interactions has been limited by a lack of measured discharge stations in the upper and lower reaches of the river, especially in the tide-river transitional zone, leading to assumptions that streamflow from upstream river is representative of streamflow in the transition zone. In addition, the differences between simulated and measured discharges in revealing tide-river interactions are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed the hydrodynamic model MIKE21 to simulate downstream river discharge as well as the cross wavelet transform (XWT) and stage-discharge rating curves to reveal the internal relationship between the simulated discharge (SD), measured water level, and tidal range. We applied this approach to the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), a large tide river, and found compelling results. Notably, near tide-river transitional zone, where the river discharge may differ significantly from the measured upstream discharge. For instance, in Jiangyin, the maximum error of the SD was equal to approximately 15\% of the measured Datong discharge (MDD), which may be caused by industrial and agricultural water use. Additionally, the use of XWT and the stage-discharge rating curve allowed us to accurately identify the positions of the river-dominated region, tide-dominated region, and tide-river transitional zone. Particularly in the upstream and downstream of Jiangyin, the R2 of the stage-discharge rating curve varied significantly. The R2 in the upstream of Jiangyin is above 0.9, while the R2 in the downstream of Jiangyin is generally below 0.4. XWT results indicated that there is a strong significant resonance period (SRP) between the SD and the tidal range and water level in the downstream of Jiangyin, while the SRP in the upstream is weaker. Our findings underscore the necessity of conducting discharge measurements in the transitional zone and tide-dominated region to gain precise insights into tide-river interactions. This work may serve as a useful reference for further investigations into tide-river interactions in estuaries across the globe.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, Miocene marine transgressions in South America have sparked ongoing debates concerning their boundaries, number of events, regional connectivity, and the existence of an epicontinental sea formed during the Andean orogeny. The bed-by-bed analysis of the Late Miocene Paran{\'a} Formation deposits in Entre R{\'i}os Province (Argentina) allow defining six facies associations: (i) beach ridge, (ii) tidal inlet channel and washover fan, (iii) outer estuarine bioherms, (iv) central estuary, (v) tidal bar and sandflat, and (vi) tidal mudflat and creek deposits. Architectural and stacking pattern analyses reveal transgressive-regressive sequences typical of the coastal strip, encompassing shallow marine to estuarine sub-environments. The analysis identified diverse ecological guilds, including bivalve and gastropod assemblages in bioherms, and crustacean traces in tidal flats. Regressive units are characterized by wave-dominated shoreface deposits, while transgressive units comprise fine-grained estuarine deposits interbedded with bioclastic sandstones and storm deposits. The paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data indicate normal salinity marine environments with macroinvertebrates and estuarine components and suggesting tropical brackish conditions. Plant remains point to a range of vegetative communities, including mangroves, palm forests, grasslands, humid riparian forests, and dry upland forests, reflecting tropical to subtropical and humid to semiarid environments. This study concludes that the Paran{\'a} Formation correspond to a third-order transgressive system tract influenced by the Miocene Paranaense Sea. The basin-scale implications suggest that the distal Chaco-Paran{\'a} basin was affected by eustatic changes due to its low accommodation and topographic relief. The Chaco-Paran{\'a} foreland basin's evolution was driven by interactions between tectonic, climatic, and eustatic processes. The comprehensive analysis of sedimentary and fossil records provides a detailed paleogeographic reconstruction of the Miocene marine transgression in southern South America.},
