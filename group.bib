  abstract = {In the ecological studies of the Amazon region, more attention has been paid to the aquatic systems than to the terrestrial ones. In particular, emphasis has focused on freshwater nutrients. It appeared from the outset that the waters of the region were chemically and physically very heterogeneous, and that in general, chemically poor waters predominated. The first classification of Amazonian freshwaters (Sioli 1950) was based mainly on optical characteristics, and distinguished blackwater, with a high content of humic compounds, whitewater, with a high content of suspended sediment, and clearwater, which is neither turbid with suspensoids or coloured by humic compounds. However, chemical analyses showed that in spite of the generally low levels of electrolytes, there were considerable differences in water chemistry between individual water bodies of a particular optical type (Sioli 1953, 1957a, 1968a). This was found to be the case particularly with the clearwaters (Sioli 1965a, 1968a). Thus the optical types could not be clearly separated on the basis of ionic composition. Differences in water chemistry were, however, closely linked with the geological, geochemical and petrographic properties of the source regions of the waters (Gibbs 1967; Sioli 1968a; Fittkau 1974). Markedly acid, electrolyte-poor waters arise in the highly weathered tertiary sediments which cover vast areas of the Central Amazonian lowlands (Sioli 1954b; Fittkau 1964, 1967; Schmidt 1972a; Furch 1976; Irion 1976; Stallard 1978; Furch \& Junk 1980; Stallard 1980).},

  abstract = {The Paran{\'a} River is one of the world's largest fluvial systems due to its discharge. During the last 30 years, water discharge has averaged 18,389~m3~s-1 downstream of the Paraguay-Paran{\'a} confluence, where its most important tributaries, the Paraguay and the upper Paran{\'a} rivers contribute 22\% and 78\% of its total discharge, respectively. However, the sedimentological dynamics of this system behaves peculiarly due to the influence of the Bermejo River, a tributary of the Paraguay River. Even though the contribution of the Bermejo River discharge represents only 2\% of the Paran{\'a} River discharge, its input of suspended sediments is significant due to the erosive processes in the upper Bermejo basin. Most earlier studies have primarily focused on the contributions and dynamics of the wash load (silt and clay) from the Bermejo River through the Paraguay River to the Paran{\'a} River, and neglected the relevance of fine and very fine sands (coarser than 63~{$\mu$}m). These sediment fractions play a key role in bed sediment composition, roughness, and bed forms, ultimately modifying the flow resistance and the morphodynamic processes, among other environmental and biological parameters. This study seeks to quantify the suspended sediment contribution of the main tributaries of the middle Paran{\'a} River during the last three decades. In particular, water discharge, sediment transport and grain size data measured at gage stations located at the Paraguay River upper reach, the Bermejo River, and the upper and middle reaches of the Paran{\'a} River are analyzed. Focus is placed on the coarse suspended sediment fraction. Additionally, the authors collected sediment samples at different river cross-sections and water discharges. The temporal analysis revealed the dynamic behavior of the sediments along the system. The results show different behaviors of the wash load and suspended sand transport provided by the Bermejo River. Along the middle Paran{\'a} reach, results suggest a significant suspended coarse fraction deposition during the highest sediment input period. Bed sediments, in turn, are re-suspended during the months with low contributions from the Bermejo and/or during the high water levels stages of the Paran{\'a}. This sediment dynamics produces a complex pattern of coarse sediment transport in the Paran{\'a} River at its middle reach, also modifying the sedimentological characteristics of the river bed.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the geological evolution of the Paran{\'a} River in Corrientes Province, located inside the Mesopotamic Argentine region, and reviews the principal geomorphological and hydro-sedimentological characteristics of this outstanding fluvial system. Active lateral migration of the Paran{\'a} River inside its large alluvial fan, which covers the north-western portion of Corrientes Province, reveals a structural control related to the separation and breakup of Gondwana. The lowlands now present in this region receive only pluvial input and constitute one of the largest wetlands in South America, the Esteros del Iber{\'a}. The best exposed geological units in Corrientes Province are the Ituzaing{\'o} Formation (Plio-Pleistocene) that is a fluvial deposit associated with evolution of the Paran{\'a} River, and the Torop{\'i}-Yupo{\'i} Formation (Pleistocene), a younger palustrine fill generated by deposition of aeolian sediment over the underlying fluvial sands. The present planform pattern of the Paran{\'a} River in Corrientes Province is anabranching with several types of bar that occupy more than 30\% of the channel surface. The bed sediment is predominantly medium to fine sand with the dominant bedform being dunes, which thus also dominate its subsurface sedimentary architecture. The suspended sediment concentration of the Paran{\'a} River downstream from its confluence with the Paraguay River (its main tributary) is asymmetric across the channel width, with higher concentrations towards the west due to the much higher input of sediment from the Paraguay River, which in turn receives most of its suspended sediment from the Bermejo River. At Corrientes City, suspended sediment concentration shows extremes ranging from 1 to 616~mg~L-1 on the eastern margin and from 8 to 1271~mg~L-1 on the western margin. Mixing between the Paran{\'a} and Paraguay rivers flows may take more than 600~km downstream before full mixing is achieved, with the mixing processes at the junction being determined by the discharge (momentum) ratio between the two confluent rivers, topographically-driven flows and the possible influence of density driven underflows at their interface. The confluence area between the Paran{\'a} and Paraguay rivers is characterized by a large scour that is {$\sim$}30~m deep, with its deepest location being at the mouth of the Paraguay River where the channel narrows due to local bedrock control. Due to the different elevation of the Paran{\'a} River margins in the region downstream of the confluence, the contemporary floodplain is developed extensively only on the western margin. This floodplain can also be considered as proximal (flooded yearly) or distal (flooded only during extraordinary events) in its geomorphic character. Most of the headwaters of small tributaries in this part of the Paran{\'a} River basin are located in wetlands. In these wetlands, the channel beds are characterized by fine sediment consisting of silt and cohesive clays, and where the suspended sediment has a high proportion of organic matter.},

  abstract = {The demand for construction-grade sand is growing at a tremendous rate and the world is expected to run out of this resource by 2050. Construction-grade sand, hereafter referred to as `sand', can be found in (former) aquatic environments, such as rivers and is a provisioning ecosystem service. Even under controlled circumstances, the practice of extracting the sand from the riverbed and -banks impacts the environment. Unfortunately, many countries lack sand mining regulation policies and in combination with a high demand, this results in indiscriminate and illegal mining. To create effective policies for sustainable extraction of river sand, there is a need for both qualitative and quantitative data on the effects of river sand mining. This paper brings together the effects of river sand mining on the physical, biological, chemical, and anthropogenic environment through a systematic literature review. The effects found are widespread and often cumulative. In the physical environment, the primary effects are riverbed widening and lowering. In the biological environment, the overarching effect is a reduced biodiversity and stretches from the aquatic and shoreline flora and fauna to the whole floodplain area. The effects on the chemical environment are a reduced water, air and soil quality through pollution. The effects on the anthropogenic environment comprise of damaged infrastructure, bad working circumstances for workers, limited access to water and agricultural losses. The findings of this research emphasize the complexity and cascading nature of the effects of river sand mining, as well as the severity and urgency of the problem. Based on the effects found and the four environments, a set of guidelines are proposed at the end of this paper to be used for global agenda making regarding sustainable sand extraction. Future research should prioritise quantifying the observed effects and developing science-based policies for sustainable mining.},

Measurements of environmental variables were performed at 0.1~m intervals from the surface to the bottom of the lake during the dry and wet seasons. High water level and strong solar radiation increased temperature stratification. River discharges during the wet season, and unsustainable sand mining activities led to an increased turbidity exceeding 100~NTU, and reduced transparency, which changed the temperature variation and subsequently altered the water quality pattern.},
